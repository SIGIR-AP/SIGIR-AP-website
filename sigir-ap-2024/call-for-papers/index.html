                            The annual SIGIR-AP (Asia/Pacific) conference is a new regional conference on Information Retrieval. After the 1st SIGIR-AP conference in Beijing, China, the 2nd SIGIR-AP conference (SIGIR-AP 2024) will be run as a hybrid conference from December 9th to 12th, 2024, in Tokyo, Japan. The authors of accepted papers can present their work in person or remotely at the conference. <br>
                            The scope of SIGIR-AP is the same as that of SIGIR. We welcome high-quality papers with contributions related to information retrieval. There are two types of SIGIR-AP submissions: <strong>Regular submissions</strong> and <strong>SIGIR-Revise-and-Resubmit submissions</strong>.
                        </p>

                            -->
                            Regular submissions are new, original contributions that have not been accepted elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. We also welcome submissions of Resource and Reproducibility papers. Resource papers describe new resources available to the community, including test collections, software tools, and services for information retrieval and access tasks. Reproducibility papers repeat, reproduce, generalize, and re-examine prior work, with the focus on generating new findings of established approaches akin to a test of time. We encourage authors to make as many of the resources associated with a paper publicly available.

                            SIGIR-RR submissions are for revised manuscripts of either full or short papers that were submitted to but not accepted by the SIGIR 2024 conference (this option is not available for other SIGIR paper tracks, e.g., perspectives, resources, or reproducibility). Authors can use this option to address the issues raised in the SIGIR 2024 reviews and revise the paper accordingly.

                        <p class="margin-top-0">
                            All submissions of papers must be original and have not been published or accepted elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Submissions of regular and SIGIR-RR papers must be in English, in PDF format, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/acm-official">Overleaf</a> templates are available from the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Website</a> (use the "sigconf" proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word).<br>  
                            
                            We adopt a double-anonymized, single-track reviewing procedure, which allows submissions of papers commensurate with their contribution sizes (i.e., we don't have two tracks for full and short papers, respectively).<br>  
 
                            Submissions of papers must be at least 2 pages and at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unlimited pages for references. While we do not set separate submission tracks for full and short papers, the assessment of each submission will be based on whether the paper length is commensurate with its contribution. For example, a 2-page paper would be accepted if its scientific contribution is worth 2 pages. However, a 9-page paper would be considered weak if it only contains the substance of a 4-page paper.<br> 

                            Submissions must be
                            anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair:

                        <p>
                            <strong>Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy</strong>:<br>
                            The review process is double-anonymized. Authors must take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submissions. The submissions must not include any author information. The citations and discussions of authors' prior work should be anonymized or written in the third person form. It is acceptable to explicitly refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions if it does not necessarily imply the authors are affiliated with these mentioned organizations. The authors can submit to SIGIR-AP 2024 papers that have been posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or will be posted in the future, after submission. In such cases, the authors should take reasonable actions to make the submission non-discoverable; e.g., by changing the title of the submission. SIGIR-AP follows the <a href="https://sigir-2024.github.io/policy_arxiv.html">SIGIR 2024 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy</a>, and breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.<br>

                            <strong>Dual-submission Policy</strong>:<br>
                            Submissions must present original work that is not under review at any other peer reviewed conferences/journals. An exception is made for  CIKM 2024, as its notification deadline is one week after the SIGIR-AP submission deadline. Authors of submissions that are under review at CIKM2024 must: (1) inform SIGIR-AP PC chairs about their dual submission by sending an email to sigir-ap2024pc@list.waseda.jp with subject: "SIGIR-AP CIKM Dual submission: &lt;SIGIR-AP Submission ID&gt;", (2) withdraw the submission from SIGIR-AP 2024 upon receiving acceptance notification of CIKM 2024.<br>

                            <strong>Desk Rejection Policy</strong>:<br>
                            Submissions that violate the anonymity policy and pre-print policy, do not adhere to formatting or length requirements, lack topical fit for SIGIR, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs.<br>

                            <strong>Authorship Policy</strong>:<br>
                            Authors should carefully read <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship">ACM's authorship policy</a> before submitting a paper. To identify reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. Changes to the author list after the abstract submission are not allowed. At least one author of each accepted paper should register for the conference and present the work, either in person or remotely, at the conference.<br> 
 
                            <strong>ACM Publication Policy</strong>:<br>
